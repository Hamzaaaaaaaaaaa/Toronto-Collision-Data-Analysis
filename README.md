Key Highlights - 
1. Data Preparation and Cleaning:
Cleaned and processed over 660,000 records from Toronto Police Serviceâ€™s Motor Vehicle Collision (MVC) dataset.
Handled missing values, converted data types (including categorical and geographical data), and performed one-hot encoding for neighborhood data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA to discover key patterns in collision data, focusing on trends across neighborhoods, time, and vehicle types.
Separated numerical and categorical columns for independent analysis, making the dataset ready for predictive modeling.
3. Predictive Modeling:
Developed and implemented a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict peak collision times across Toronto neighborhoods.
Evaluated multiple machine learning models (Gradient Boosting, MLP Regressor, and Random Forest) to optimize performance.
Achieved an MAE of 4.031 and MSE of 24.595 using Gradient Boosting Regressor for accurate peak time predictions.
4. Interactive Dashboard Design:
Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics (collisions, property damage, injuries, fatalities) and trends (year, month, hour).
Integrated predictive insights into the dashboard, allowing users to explore peak collision times and hotspots through interactive geospatial visualizations.
Provided a drill-down feature for detailed neighborhood-level collision analysis.
5. Solution Optimization and Automation:
Suggested enhancements such as integrating real-time data, incorporating additional features (weather, traffic volume), and automating data updates for the model.
Proposed the use of cloud computing infrastructure for more efficient model training and execution.
